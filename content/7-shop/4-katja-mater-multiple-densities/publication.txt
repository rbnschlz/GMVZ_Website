Description: This publication brings together works made between 2010 and 2013 that share the same principle: a method of constructing images of time by layering multiple moments, creating hybrids between photography and other media, documenting something that is positioned beyond our human ability to see. Each series adds a different parameter to the principle, such as two- and three- dimensional space, scale, perspective, performance, installation and parallel events. The publication also features an alternative view on Materâ€™s practice with a chapter of research and process material.
