Description: 

Martin van Zomeren is proud to present ‘You will just have to take my word for it’, the fourth solo exhibition by Katja Mater at the gallery. 

Starting from an in-depth investigation of the medium-specific parameters of photography and film, Katja Mater meditates on time, space, perception and performance. The artist explores the tension between photographic and human perception and turning the medium on itself, she reveals photography as a non-transparent medium. By capturing areas where photography hardly behaves like the human eye, she shows alternatives to reality.

‘Tiled’ is a body of works that plays with time and the perception of it; a moment gets expanded and split up, unfolded and tiled back together. The c-prints capture the process of the making of a painting on objects. They all have slightly different outcomes, by overlaying different fragments of the same event on multiple negatives. Each of these negatives offers a different view on the same event in time and thereby visualizes different ways of looking at one moment in time. The split moments are then brought together to form one bigger image; the final work is both fragmented and forming a whole. This body of works playfully refers to quantum mechanics ‘Many-Worlds Interpretation’ and ‘Parallel Universes’.

‘Fields on a Line’ is a 16 mm film conceived for Katja Mater’s solo exhibition at Kiosk, Gent (2014-1015). The camera captures the process of the painting of the walls and floors of the exhibition rooms. The camera does not merely document the process: a new image is built on the 16 mm film revealing something that is not visible to the human eyes. The work is a residue of a performative act and moves in and out the flatness of the image and the three-dimensionality of space.
