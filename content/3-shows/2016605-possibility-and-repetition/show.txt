Description: 

Martin van Zomeren is pleased to present ‘Possibility and Repetition’, the second solo exhibition at the gallery of the Venezuelan artist Oscar Abraham Pabón. 

The abstract geometric tradition of modern art, crafts and occupations considered as 'minor arts' find new twists in the practice of Pabón. His works highlight their common processes and draw a transversal line linking conceptual art with manual strategies of contemporary crafts, modernist discourse with local traditions.

Repetition and possibility are key elements of all the works presented in the exhibition. The simple fact of repeating an idea over and over again leads to a set of common formal properties. 
'Transportable Geometry' is an installation made of tape measures drawing geometric patterns on the wall of the gallery. It is a work that presents endless possibilities and combinations. 'Pictorial tradition I' is a large painting made of sliding curtains that can have multiple ways of being displayed.

These works, together with 'Ceiling Sculpture' and 'Floor Sculpture' show the infinite possibilities of creating a 'plastic language'. Through these pieces, Pabón is not aiming to generate any fixed combination. He just points out those possibilities and continues exploring the sculpture and painting traditions that apparently repeat themselves. A sort of repetition that clearly produces a difference.


Oscar Pabón (b. 1984, Venezuela) is a former resident of the Rijksakademie (2013-2014). He will open this fall his solo exhibition at MAC Museo de Arte Contemporaneo, Santiago de Chile. His previous exhibitions include institutions such as Oficina # 1, Caracas (2014), Stedelijk Museum Bureau, Amsterdam (2013), Centro Colombo Americano, Bogotá (2013) and Centro de Arte Los Galpones, Caracas (2011), among others.
