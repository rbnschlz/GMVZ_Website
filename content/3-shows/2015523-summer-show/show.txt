Description: 

What's with all the black?
What black?
I just made some paintings that look black but they are not.
Turns out they are pretty much impossible to photograph.
There's not so much daylight in my studio.
You seem to be working in a bright studio.
My studio is pretty bright even without direct sunlight.
I never work at night unless it's summer.
