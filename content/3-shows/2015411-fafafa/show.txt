Description: 

Martin van Zomeren is pleased to present ‘FA FA FA’, a group exhibition with Juliaan Andeweg, Bastien Aubry & Dimitri Broquard, Jean-Baptiste Maitre, Navid Nuur and Tom Humphreys. All the works on display show different ways of dealing with the medium of ceramics. 

The ‘Corner Sculptures’ of Bastien Aubry & Dimitri Broquard structure the exhibition space. Made from melamine panels, recalling basic furniture kits and hand made ceramic brackets, the sculptures divert the materials from their usual functionality. Ceramics are no longer simply decorative pieces but are necessary to the structure of the sculptures. In the series ‘Cerebral Box’, painted and digitally transferred images are brought together in ceramic cereal boxes. The swiss duo mingles with humor modern and antique art references with cereal branding. 

The ceramic sculptures of Jean-Baptiste Maitre re-use the formal vocabulary of neon signs and play with the way original artworks are transformed by the so-called ecology of art - i.e. every text, image, film and conversation that is not an artwork but talks about it - and how it can affect the way we perceive and remember them. In these works, the artist employs ceramics to investigate how images are created and remain in our cultural collective unconscious.

Tom Humphreys’ work is often referred to as painting. However the main material is often ceramics, that is preferred to traditional supports such as canvas or paper. Printing and painting on ceramic tiles, the artist explores problems of taste always refusing any preset artistic mode of production. 

The sculpture of Juliaan Andeweg reminds an anthropomorphic oven that will eventually host alchemical experiments. Finally the work in the exhibition of Navid Nuur investigates the different possibilities within the medium of painting. In ‘Redblueredblue’ (2007-2014), all physical and emotional traces are visible and the materials themselves - and not the canvas - are used as final form.
